Scientifically you can call it energy or spiritually  you can call.... \nThe reason I put there dots was that there is no specific name that I can give to that supreme principle. Take a case of three phenomenon that happens in sea, tides, waves and bubbles. If these three phenomenon consider themselves as that they are different from each other, they are fooling themselves. Because we know that they all are water. It's just they expressed in different forms. If water is taken from all these forms, none of these phenomenon exists. That means, water is the cause of these three forms (effects) or the entire sea. If cause is removed from effect, then only cause exists. Similarly, we living beings are different expressions of God. God resides in every individual or each entity. Everything is God. Remaining everything is just for name sake.","label":0},{"review":"No doubt one of the finest movie of film industry.
