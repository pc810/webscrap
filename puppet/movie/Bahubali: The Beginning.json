His lover, an incredibly strong warrior and who truly defines representing feminine power within South Asian culture, is immediately demoted following his appearance. To show she's pretty, he strips her, puts makeup on her, and then the movie don't give her another fight scene. \nAlso, it highly employs colorism. She's immediately whiter when acting pretty and then her skin becomes darker when she puts clothes on. The opposing army and antagonists are dark skinned, greatly contrasting the lighter skinned protagonists. In every climatic scene for the protagonist, his skin is visibly lightened.\nOtherwise, the movie is really good. Since South Asian culture usually uses this tropes, it's in line with what's expected. Would love to see less of this in such a beautiful and complex story.","label":0},{"review":"You should watch this movie by giving your logical mind a backseat.
